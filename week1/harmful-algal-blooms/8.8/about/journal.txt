Source: These data were submitted by the National Coastal Data Development Center. 
        Data comes from multiple sources in Texas, Mississippi, Alabama and

Actions: Data was copied into the 0-data directory. 

Version 8.8:  This action was performed to update with data submitted since 
the AIP was last archived. The file /data/0-data/habsos__20230714.csv was 
replaced by /data/0-data/habsos_20240430.csv. 
Additionally the lonlat and map files were updated.
